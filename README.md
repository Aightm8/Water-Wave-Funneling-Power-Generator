**Description and operation**
</br>
</br>
There are pre-existing wave power energy generation systems ranging from simple buoys oscillating to the waves to turbines that use waves to generate a pressure difference that pushes air through them. This invention is different; it consists of an inlet that leads to a funnel that channels water waves to the generator region. The inlet, funnel, generator region and outlet make up an enclosure for the waves, enclosed from the sides and the bottom. Therefore as the waves pass through, the channel constricts and a volume influx is created. This volume influx is compensated for by raising the height of the waves. The generator region consists of a plurality of buoys and generator units; the Point absorbers ( buoys ) oscillate to the sea waves. A crank mechanism converts the mechanical oscillatory motion to mechanical circular motion at a generator shaft connected to a generator that converts the mechanical energy to electrical energy. As the waves that make the buoys oscillate are higher, more energy can be generated. Linear absorbers may be used instead of point absorbers.

**Advantages of the WWFPG** 
</br>
</br>
Sea waves have a certain energy per unit area. As the funnel channels the waves, the energy per unit area is increased. The waves in the generator region would have a higher value for energy per unit area that those at the inlet. Because of this, the WWFPG is the equivalent of having the plurality of generator units but expanding to cover a large area. The WWFPG however would be less costly to build and maintain as the generator region covers a smaller area.
The structure could also be used for secondary applications. For example: To collect trash flowing back towards land; Small wind turbines or solar panels could be added to collect more energy; It could collect data for research and meteorology; It could be used to dock small boats and recreational vehicles; It could also be used similar to a pier, allowing people to use it as a recreational point which could circumvent any visual pollution it would cause. Wave power in itself boasts several advantages being renewable, environmentally freindly, abundant and easily predictable.

**Limitations and solutions** 
</br>
</br>
One can expect the WWFPG to also harbour the disadvantages of wave power such as the disturbance of marine ecosystems, disturbance for marine vessels and visual pollution. However, the last two can be avoided by applying the aforementioned methods. The first would have to be avoided by staying clear of coral reefs and any other hotspots for marine life. The structure is only attached to the sea bed at the anchors so there is less disturbance. It is possible for animals to enter the WWFPG through the inlet but eventhough the waves inside will be powerful and the buoys will be oscillating, animals can still survive by swimming below the wave troughs and buoys. Considering noise pollution, the mechanical noise could be isolated within the generator units, the sound from the funneled waves would be loud but the sound of the waves should be normal enough for wildlife and residents, despite being louder.
