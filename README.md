# Water-Wave-Funneling-Power-Generator
</br>
There are pre-existing wave power energy generation systems ranging from simple buoys oscillating to the waves to turbines that use waves to generate a pressure difference that pushes air through them. This invention is different; it consists of an inlet that leads to a funnel that channels water waves to the generator region. The inlet, funnel, generator region and outlet make up an enclosure for the waves, enclosed from the sides and the bottom. Therefore as the waves pass through, the channel constricts and a volume influx is created. This volume influx is compensated for by raising the height of the waves. The generator region consists of a plurality of genrator unit; Point absorbers ( buoys ) oscillate to the sea waves. A crank mechanism converts the mechanical oscillatory motion to mechanical circular motion at a genearator shaft connected to a generator that converts the mechanical energy to electrical energy. As the waves that make the buoys oscillate are higher, more energy can be generated. Sea waves have a certain energy per unit area. As the funnel channels the waves, the energy per unit area is increased. The waves in the generator region would have a higher value for energy per unit area that those at the inlet. Because of this, the WWFPG is the equivalent of having the same plurality of generator units but expanding to cover a large area. Because of this,
